#  How To Withdraw From Libya: Step-by-Step Guide

In the summer of 2011, the Libyan people revolted against Colonel Muammar el-Qaddafi’s four-decade rule. The uprising quickly turned into a civil war, and on March 19, 2011, the U.N. Security Council adopted Resolution 1973, which authorized “all necessary measures” to protect Libyan civilians. On August 23, 2011, NATO began its air campaign in Libya. In October 2011, rebel forces defeated Qaddafi’s forces and he was killed. On November 21, 2011, the National Transitional Council (NTC) declared Libya liberated.

In August 2014, two rival governments were formed: the General National Congress (GNC) in Tripoli and the House of Representatives (HoR) in Tobruk. The HoR is recognized by the international community while the GNC is not. In December 2015, representatives from both governments signed a UN-brokered agreement to form a unity government known as the Government of National Accord (GNA). However, the GNA has not been able to take control of Libya due to fighting between militias loyal to the GNC and HoR.

The situation in Libya continues to deteriorate as militias battle for control of territory and resources. There are now three main factions: 1) The Libyan National Army (LNA) led by Field Marshal Khalifa Haftar which controls eastern Libya; 2) The Misratan Saraya Dignity coalition which controls western Libya; and 3) The Benghazi Defense Brigades which controls central Libya.

On January 17, 2019, Haftar launched an offensive on Benghazi called “Operation Volcano” with the goal of defeating the Benghazi Defense Brigades. The offensive has led to widespread human rights abuses including arbitrary detention, forced displacement, and indiscriminate attacks that have killed and injured civilians.

If you are a foreigner living in Libya or you want to leave Libya because of the conflict or for any other reason, this guide will tell you what you need to do to withdraw from Libya.

1. Check if you need a visa

Libya is a party to the Schengen Agreement so if you are a citizen of one of the countries in Schengen Area or have a valid Schengen visa, you do not need a visa to enter Libya. If you are not a citizen of a Schengen country or do not have a valid Schengen visa, you will need a visa to enter Libya. You can check here whether your country is a party to the Schengen Agreement: https://www.schengenvisa-info.com/countries-in-schengen-area/.

2. Get an exit visa if required

If you are not a citizen of one of the countries in Schengen Area or do not have a valid Schengen visa and you need a visa to enter Libya, you will also need an exit visa to leave Libya. An exit visa is issued by the Immigration Department in Tripoli and costs 400 Dinars (around $320).

#  Conflict In Libya: How To Effectively WITHDRAW 

In 2011, after the Arab Spring uprisings, civil war broke out in Libya as rebels sought to overthrow then-leader Muammar Gaddafi. The ensuing conflict has since resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands of people and the displacement of over two million.

Given this ongoing humanitarian crisis, how should the international community best withdraw from Libya?

There are a number of considerations that need to be taken into account when formulating a withdrawal strategy for Libya. First and foremost, any such plan must be carried out in a way that protects civilians and avoids further bloodshed. It is also important to ensure that any withdrawal does not create a power vacuum that could lead to even greater chaos and instability in the country.

In addition, it is crucial that any withdrawal plan takes into account the complex security landscape in Libya. The country is home to a number of rival militias, each with their own interests and agendas. Any withdrawal must therefore be carefully planned and executed in order to avoid exacerbating these existing tensions.

Finally, any withdrawal plan must also be affordable and achievable. It is imperative that we do not ask too much of our troops or risk compromising their safety. At the same time, any withdrawal plan must have realistic goals and objectives which can be realistically achieved.

With all of these factors in mind, I believe there are four key principles that should guide any withdrawal plan for Libya: 

1) Protection of civilians must be the top priority 
2) A phased approach should be adopted, withdrawing progressively from different parts of the country  3) Militias must be prevented from taking control after international troops leave  4) The cost and feasibility of the withdrawal plan must be considered 


Looking specifically at how each of these principles could be put into practice, I would propose the following phased approach: 

Phase One: Withdrawal from Libyan coastal towns and cities This phase would involve withdrawing troops from all coastal towns and cities – including Tripoli – while maintaining a presence offshore to protect civilians. This would allow local forces to take over security within these areas. 
Phase Two: Transition to an advisory role In this phase, international troops would move to an advisory role within Libya’s military institutions whilst maintaining a presence on Libyan soil to advise on best practices for protecting civilians and complying with Human Rights Law. 
Phase Three: Complete Withdrawal This would involve withdrawing all troops from Libyan soil and transitioning wholly to an advisory role. 

It is important to note that this phased approach is by no means definitive; it is merely one possible option amongst many. Whatever strategy is ultimately adopted, it is critical that it prioritises the protection of Libyans civilians above all else

#  Military Expert Breaks Down Best Way To WITHDRAW From Libya Conflict

Military expert and former U.S. Army officer David Kilcullen offered his insights on the best way for the United States to withdraw from the conflict in Libya, during a presentation at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace on Wednesday.

Kilcullen highlighted three principles that should guide the withdrawal process: "first, don't make things worse; second, preserve our credibility; and third, protect our interests."

He offered several specific recommendations for how to execute a withdrawal strategy that adheres to those principles. One of his key suggestions was to establish an international contact group to oversee the withdrawal and help manage potential fallout from the decision.

"The big worry is not what will happen during the withdrawal but what will happen afterward," he said, noting that without proper planning and oversight, "the situation could easily unravel."

Kilcullen also warned against allowing private militias or other armed groups to fill the vacuum left by departing U.S. forces, as this could lead to even more chaos and violence. He urged instead for a phased withdrawal of all military personnel, including contractors and intelligence operatives, that would be overseen by the contact group.

"A premature exit could easily lead to civil war or even failed state status," he said.

#  What You Need To Know About Withdrawing From A Conflict In Libya

No one ever wants to be in a conflict, but sometimes it's necessary. If you're ever faced with the decision to withdraw from a conflict in Libya, here are some things you need to know first:

What Is The Situation In Libya?

The situation in Libya is very complex and constantly changing. There are several factions fighting for control of the country, and it's not always clear who is in charge at any given time. The United Nations has recognized the Government of National Accord (GNA) as the legitimate government of Libya, but they don't have complete control over the country.

Can I Withdraw From A Conflict In Libya?

It depends on your status and the situation on the ground. If you're an American citizen, you can't simply withdraw from a conflict in Libya without authorization from the government. You may also be required to gain clearance from NATO or other international organizations before withdrawing from a conflict in Libya. If you're not an American citizen, withdrawal from a conflict in Libya may be less complicated, but you should still consult with a lawyer or other legal expert to ensure you're taking the right steps.

What Are The Risks Of Withdrawing From A Conflict In Libya?

There are many risks associated with withdrawing from a conflict in Libya. First and foremost, you could put yourself and others in danger by withdrawing prematurely or without proper planning. Additionally, there's no guarantee that things will improve if you do withdraw from the conflict; it's possible that things will only get worse. Finally, there's always the risk that your withdrawal could embolden your opponents and lead to further violence.

#  How Worried Should You Be About The Withdrawal From Libya?

On 19 March 2019, President Donald Trump announced that the United States would be withdrawing troops from Libya “immediately.” This announcement has created a great deal of concern and speculation about the future of Libya. The following is an overview of the situation in Libya and what this announcement could mean for the country.

The withdrawal from Libya is part of a larger trend by the Trump administration to reduce American military presence around the world. Prior to this announcement, Trump had also ordered a withdrawal of troops from Syria and Afghanistan. The decision to withdraw troops from Libya has been met with criticism both in the United States and abroad. Many have questioned why Trump is choosing to abandon Libya when the country is still in such a precarious state.

Since 2011, Libya has been embroiled in a civil war that has resulted in the death of thousands of people and the displacement of millions. The war began after longtime dictator Muammar Gaddafi was overthrown and killed. Since then, there have been numerous attempts to establish a new government, but all have failed. The current situation in Libya is extremely chaotic, with multiple militias competing for control of the country.

The withdrawal from Libya is likely to have a number of consequences for the country. One possibility is that it will lead to an increase in violence as different factions compete for control. It could also lead to further instability and allow extremist groups like ISIS to gain a foothold in the country. Another concern is that the withdrawal could pave the way for Russia or China to become more involved in Libya, which could further destabilize the region.

So far, there has been no word on what will happen to the American troops who are currently stationed in Libya. It is possible that they will be withdrawn as well, or that some may remain behind to help secure oil fields or other interests. It remains to be seen what impact Trump’s announcement will have on Libya and how much worse things will get for the people there.
