#  How to Be a Pro at Sports Betting: Knicks Edition 

The National Basketball Association (NBA) is a professional basketball league in the United States. The NBA is one of the four major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada. The NBA is divided into two conferences: the Eastern Conference and the Western Conference. Each conference is divided into three divisions: the Atlantic Division, the Central Division, and the Pacific Division.

The Knicks are a team in the Eastern Conference’s Atlantic Division. The Knicks play their home games at Madison Square Garden in Manhattan, New York City. The Knicks are owned by Madison Square Garden Company, which also owns the New York Rangers of the National Hockey League (NHL) and New York Liberty of the Women’s National Basketball Association (WNBA).

The Knicks were founded in 1946 as part of the Basketball Association of America (BAA), which became the National Basketball Association (NBA) after merging with its rival, the American Basketball League (ABL), in 1949. The Knicks were one of eight original franchises to join the NBA in its inaugural season. In 1970, the Knicks moved from Ebbets Field to Madison Square Garden. In 1972, they won their first championship. They made it back to the finals twice more during that decade but lost each time. They reached their fourth and most recent championship in 1999 but lost to the San Antonio Spurs in five games.

The Knicks have played at Madison Square Garden since 1971, except for two seasons spent at Radio City Music Hall whileMadison Square Garden was being renovated. Madison Square Garden is often referred to as “the world’s most famous arena”.[7] It is said that no venue has hosted more championship fights or been home to more legendary athletes than Madison Square Garden. 

You can make money betting on professional sports; it just takes some skill, research, and knowledge about how teams play against each other. In this article we are going to give you a breakdown for how to bet on professional basketball games specifically involving The New York Knicks when they are playing away from home against an Eastern Conference opponent . 

There are a few different ways that you can wager on these types of matchups . You can bet on who will win straight up (SU), or you can place bets on whether or not you think there will be an over or under total number of points scored by both teams . You could also make proposition bets on individual players performances . 

Looking at The New York Knicks matchup history both SU and O/U totals against Eastern Conference opponents on away turf , we can see that they perform very well ATS (against-the-spread). In fact , over their last ten road games they are 8-2 ATS ! So if you're looking to go against Vegas odds here , taking NYK would be a good move . 

When it comes to betting Totals however , it's a different story . NYK usually plays high scoring games against Eastern Conference opponents as opposed to lower scoring affairs when playing Western Conference foes . For example , their game total against Miami this year was set at 218 points but only 203 points when matched up against Dallas . As a result , betting Totals on NYK games against Eastern foes might not always be such a great idea . 

When it comes down to proposition bets on players performances though , there tends to be better value when betting on NYK players against Eastern foes . A great example of this would be Kristaps Porzingis who typically performs very well scoring-wise against teams from his own conference . 

So now that you have a general understanding for how to bet on professional basketball games let's take a look at an example matchup between NYK and Washington Wizards : 


Washington Wizards: 

Starting Lineup: John Wall - Bradley Beal - Otto Porter Jr. - Markieff Morris - Marcin Gortat 

Bench: Tomas Satoransky - Kelly Oubre Jr. - Tim Frazier - Mike Scott - Jason Smith - Ian Mahinmi
