#  Bust Targets Local Speakeasy Casino

Neighbors of the speakeasy casino on Bust Street are up in arms about the increased noise and traffic from the new business.

The casino has been open for just two months, but complaints about the noise and traffic have been pouring in from people living near the casino. "It's really loud at night," said one resident. "And there's so much traffic now, it's impossible to get down the street."

Others have complained about the bright lights and gambling happening right outside their homes. "I don't want my kids growing up around all that gambling and noise," said one parent.

The owner of the casino says he is doing everything he can to address the concerns of his neighbors. "We've put in soundproofing walls and we're trying to keep the noise down at night," he said. "And we're not going to let anyone gamble who is underage."

Despite these efforts, the neighbors say they want the casino closed down. "It's just a nuisance," said one resident. "We didn't sign up for this when we moved here."

#  Illegal Gambling Ring Busted in Sanford, NC

On Wednesday, November 28, 2018, Sanford law enforcement officials announced that they had broken up an illegal gambling ring. The ring was allegedly operated out of a business in the south-central part of the city.

According to police, the gambling operation involved three people who took bets on horse races and other sporting events. Investigators believe that the ring may have been in operation for some time and may have taken in as much as $10,000 per day.

The three people arrested include:

* 50-year-old Harry Lee McCrary Jr., who is believed to be the ringleader of the operation;

* 49-year-old Jeffery Lynn Brown; and

All three were charged with engaging in bookmaking, a felony offense in North Carolina. They were each placed under a $10,000 bond and are scheduled to appear in court on December 10th.

In addition to the arrests, authorities seized several items that they believe were used in connection with the gambling ring, including computers, betting slips, and cash.
