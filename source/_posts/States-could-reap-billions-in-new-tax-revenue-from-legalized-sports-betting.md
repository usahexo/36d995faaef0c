#  States could reap billions in new tax revenue from legalized sports betting

Governments could gain an infusion of new tax revenue if sports betting is legalized in the United States, according to a report from the National Gambling Impact Study Commission.

The report, released earlier this year, found that legalizing sports betting could generate between $5.6 billion and $8.7 billion in new annual tax revenue for states. That’s on top of the billions of dollars that states already earn each year from gambling operations.

“This is money states are leaving on the table by not legalizing sports betting,” commission chairman Alan Ehrenhalt said in a statement accompanying the report’s release.

The findings come as several states are considering measures to legalize sports betting in the wake of a landmark U.S. Supreme Court ruling last year that struck down a federal law banning the practice.

West Virginia became the first state to allow sports betting after the court’s decision when it passed legislation authorizing wagers on professional and college sporting events in March. Other states, including New Jersey and Pennsylvania, are moving forward with similar proposals.

Legalizing sports betting would provide a new stream of revenue for governments at a time when they are facing increasing budget pressures. It also could help support tourism and create jobs in the gaming industry.

But before states can tap into this potential new source of revenue, they need to put in place policies and regulations governing sports betting operations. This includes setting minimum age requirements for bettors, establishing limits on how much people can bet, and implementing measures to protect consumers from addiction and fraud.

States that choose to legalize sports betting will also need to partner with casino operators or other gaming companies to offer these services. This could provide a new opportunity for these businesses, which have been struggling in recent years due to increased competition from online gambling sites.

#  NFL, NBA, MLB and NCAA opposing legalized sports betting

The four biggest professional sports leagues in the United States, the NFL, NBA, MLB and NCAA, oppose legalized sports betting. In a joint statement Wednesday, they announced their opposition to a proposed federal law that would legalize sports betting across the country. The law would overturn a 25-year-old ban on sports betting in most states.

"We believe that this legislation is fundamentally flawed and we strongly oppose it," the statement read. "We are not opposed to legal sports betting; in fact, we are supportive of it. We just want it to be done correctly."

The leagues argue that legalizing sports betting would lead to game-fixing and other integrity issues, as well as increase the potential for addiction among gamblers. They are also concerned about the impact on children who might see gambling as a normalized behavior.

"This is an issue that our league families care passionately about and we will continue to work with elected officials across the country to ensure that any legislation allows for a strong enough regulatory framework that protects our fans and our sport," the statement continued.

In response to the leagues' announcement, Sen. Charles Schumer (D-NY) said he was "disappointed but not surprised." Schumer is one of the sponsors of the proposed bill and has argued that legalized sports betting would bring in billions of dollars in revenue for states. He accused the leagues of being motivated by greed, saying they were trying to protect their monopoly on gambling.

It remains to be seen whether or not Congress will pass legislation legalizing sports betting. If it does, it's likely that the leagues will sue to block it.

#  New Jersey wins Supreme Court case paving way for legalized sports betting

On Monday, the US Supreme Court struck down a federal law that barred most states from legalizing sports betting, paves way for legalized sports betting in many states. The decision deals a major blow to the NCAA, major league sports leagues and the Trump administration.

The 6-3 ruling is a victory for New Jersey, which has been trying to legalize sports betting at its casinos and racetracks for years. The state had argued that the 1992 Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA) violated the Tenth Amendment of the Constitution, which reserves powers not delegated to the federal government to the states.

Justice Samuel Alito wrote for the majority opinion, “The legalization of sports gambling requires an important policy choice, but the choice is not ours to make. Congress can regulate sports gambling directly, but if it elects not to do so, each state is free to act on its own. Our job is to interpret the law Congress has enacted and decide whether it is consistent with the Constitution. PASPA is not.”

Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan concurred with Alito’s majority opinion. Chief Justice John Roberts dissented along with Justices Anthony Kennedy and Clarence Thomas.

The NCAA had argued that PASPA protected amateur athletes from being corrupted by payments from gamblers, while professional leagues said it was necessary to maintain public confidence in their product. But Justice Alito dismissed these concerns as “not supported by either empirical evidence or common sense”.

“Our decision today will make official what has been true for years in Nevada and other states that have allowed sports betting: Gambling on sporting events is a popular form of entertainment enjoyed by millions of Americans,” he wrote.

Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg agreed with Alito’s assertion that PASPA violated states rights under the Tenth Amendment but also highlighted how discrimination against women had factored into New Jersey’s case. She noted how Nevada had been exempted from PASPA while New Jersey – which includes two casinos owned by women – was not. “ presented an equal protection challenge because certain States were given preferential treatment under PASPA – specifically, States that did not ban gambling on sporting events altogether. New Jersey pointed out quite convincingly that men have always been free to place bets at Nevada casinos whereas women have been denied that opportunity solely because of their gender.,” she wrote .

#  Wall Street analysts say legalized sports betting good for business

The news that the US Supreme Court had overturned a federal law prohibiting sports betting sent shockwaves through the business and sporting communities. The 6-3 ruling found that the 1992 law known as the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA) violated states’ rights to make their own laws.

Now that sports betting is legalized, what does this mean for businesses? Wall Street analysts say that the repeal is good news for businesses, as it will create a new market for them to tap into. Goldman Sachs released a report in which it estimated that the legal sports betting market could be worth up to $150 billion.

This would be a major boon for businesses such as casinos and bookmakers, who have seen their profits decline in recent years due to the rise of offshore gambling websites. In fact, some experts are predicting that legalized sports betting could lead to a casino renaissance, with new casinos being built in states where gambling was previously illegal.

 legalizing sports betting will also create jobs. The American Gaming Association estimates that legalization will create between 140,000 and 165,000 jobs in the United States. These jobs will include positions such as casino dealers, bookmakers, and information technology specialists.

Legalized sports betting is also expected to generate billions of dollars in tax revenue for states. This money can be used to fund important initiatives such as education and infrastructure projects.

So far, only a handful of states have moved to legalize sports betting following the Supreme Court’s ruling. However, it is expected that more states will follow suit in the coming months and years. This presents a major opportunity for businesses who are looking to get involved in the burgeoning legalized sports betting market.

#  How will legalized sports betting impact the gambling industry?

The potential legalization of sports betting in the United States has sent shockwaves throughout the gambling industry. With a market worth an estimated $150 billion, the industry is preparing for a major upheaval if sports betting is made legal.

Casinos and race tracks are lobbying to be included in any legislation that allows sports betting, while online gambling companies are gearing up for a major expansion into the U.S. market. The traditional gambling companies see sports betting as a way to reinvigorate their businesses, while the online companies view it as an opportunity to break into a new and lucrative market.

There is also significant interest from major sporting leagues, who see sports betting as a way to increase revenue. The NBA, NFL, and MLB have all lined up in support of legalized sports betting, arguing that it will help keep fans engaged in the games.

Opposition to legalized sports betting remains strong, however, with many lawmakers and religious groups voicing concerns about the impact on society. There are also questions about how effective regulation would be, and whether or not enough safeguards are in place to protect consumers from fraud and addiction.

Despite the opposition, momentum is growing for legalized sports betting and it could be only a matter of time before it becomes a reality. The gambling industry is preparing for a major shakeup, and it will be interesting to see how it all plays out.
