#  How Does Shamrock Treasures Casino Blackjack Tournament Work? 

Shamrock Treasures Casino is one the most popular online casinos that offer blackjack tournaments. The casino has amazing graphics and a wide variety of slot games, table games, and more. Players can enjoy amazing bonuses, including a 100% welcome bonus on their first deposit up to $1,000.

The blackjack tournament at Shamrock Treasures Casino works a little differently than other tournaments. Rather than having a predetermined number of players, the tournament starts as soon as enough players have registered. This means that the tournament can start with just two players or as many as 100 players.

The tournament begins with all players being dealt two cards face up. The player with the highest card starts the bidding and can either hit or stand. The next player then either hits or stands depending on what the first player did. This continues until either all players have busted or everyone has stood. The player with the highest hand at the end of the hand wins the pot.

One thing to keep in mind is that in a blackjack tournament, you are playing against other players, not the dealer. This means that you want to make sure you are aware of what everyone else is doing so you don't wind up busting when you could have won!
