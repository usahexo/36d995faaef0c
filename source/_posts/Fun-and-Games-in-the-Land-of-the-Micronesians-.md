#  Discovering the Many Faces of Blackjack in Micronesia

Micronesia is a sovereign country in the Western Pacific. It is made up of more than 600 islands, which are divided into four states: Chuuk, Kosrae, Pohnpei, and Yap. Each of these states has its own distinct culture, language, and landscape.

Despite this diversity, one thing that unites the people of Micronesia is their love of blackjack. In fact, blackjack is such a popular game in Micronesia that there are several variations that are unique to the region.

If you're looking for a unique gambling experience, then Micronesia is the place to be. Here are some of the most intriguing blackjack variants you'll find in Micronesia:

1. Lucky Seven

Lucky Seven is a blackjack variant that is popular in Pohnpei. The game begins with each player being dealt two cards face down. The player then decides whether to hit or stand. Once all players have either hit or stood, the dealer flips over their two cards. The player with the highest total (not including a tie) wins the hand. If two or more players have the same total, then the pot is split between them.



2. Double Exposure Blackjack

Double Exposure Blackjack is a variation of blackjack that is popular in Kosrae and Yap. As its name suggests, double exposure means that both dealer cards are face up when the hand begins. This makes it easier for players to make decisions, as they can see what cards the dealer has left in Play. The aim of the game is to beat the dealer's hand without going bust.


3. Pontoon

Pontoon is a blackjack variant that is popular in Chuuk State and Pohnpei State. The game is played with eight decks of cards, and each player is dealt two cards face down and one card face up. The player then decides whether to hit or stand; if they choose to hit, they must hit again unless they have less than five points total (in which case they must stand). The aim of pontoon is to beat the dealer's hand without going bust (i.e., having a total greater than 21). If the player and dealer have identical hands, then the pot is split between them
