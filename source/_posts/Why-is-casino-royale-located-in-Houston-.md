#  Why is casino royale located in Houston? 

One of the most frequently asked questions about Casino Royale is why it is located in Houston. The answer to this question is actually quite simple – the casino was built in Houston because that is where the founders of the casino were from.

Casino Royale was founded by two brothers, Milton and Herbert Bush, in 1967. The brothers were born and raised in Houston, and they decided to open their casino there because they believed that it would be a successful location. At the time, Houston was a major city with a population of over 1 million people, and it was also home to several other casinos.

The Bush brothers were correct in their assessment of the Houston market; Casino Royale became a popular destination for gamblers as well as locals and tourists alike. In fact, the casino was so successful that it eventually grew into one of the largest gaming facilities in the state of Texas.

Although Casino Royale is no longer owned by the Bush brothers, it remains headquartered in Houston to this day. The casino has undergone several changes over the years, but its commitment to providing high-quality gambling experiences has remained unchanged.

Others offer bonuses for depositing money or playing a certain game.

# What kind of customer support does it have? 

If you have any questions or problems while playing at a casino, it is important that they have good customer support. Many casinos have 24/7 support available through phone, email, and live chat.

#  What was the motivation for moving the Rockets to Houston? 

Houston Rockets owner Leslie Alexander cited several reasons for wanting to move his team from San Diego to Houston in 1971. Among them were the lack of an adequate arena in San Diego and the desire to be closer to his team's natural fan base in Texas. He also felt that moving to a major market like Houston would give the Rockets more visibility and help them compete against larger teams like the Lakers and Celtics.
