#  Southampton FC make casino-style bet!

Southampton FC have announced a joint venture with casino group LeoVegas which will see the club become the first in the Premier League to have a dedicated betting and gaming space. The new area, which will be known as 'The LeoVegas Sport Lounge' and is situated in the south-east corner of St Mary's Stadium, is open to both home and away fans on match days.

Not only does this give Saints supporters a new place to congregate on match days, but it also offers an opportunity to gamble on their team! This has led to some raised eyebrows among fans and pundits alike, with many questioning whether a football club should be mixing gambling with sport.

However, Southampton's vice-chairman Ralph Krueger insists that this is not a casino, but rather a "sport lounge" where fans can enjoy a drink and a bet in a "casino-style" environment without having to leave the stadium. He also points out that the club are not taking any money from the venture, and that all profits will be reinvested back into the club.

Whether you agree with it or not, this is certainly a bold move by Southampton FC and one which could potentially pay off big time!

#  How Southampton FC make their money!

Southampton Football Club is an English professional association football club based in Southampton, Hampshire. The club played in the Southern League until 1921, when they were elected to the Football League Third Division. Southampton FC have made a lot of money over the years, and here we will take a look at how they have achieved this!

Southampton’s main income stream is match day revenue. In the 2014-15 season, this amounted to £25 million. This was mainly generated through ticket sales, with an average attendance of 31,955. Southampton also benefit from their share of broadcasting and commercial rights deals. In the 2014-15 season, this amounted to £51 million. This was largely due to the club reaching the Europa League final.

Sponsorship is also a key source of revenue for Southampton FC. In the 2014-15 season, sponsorship deals generated £8 million for the club. This figure is set to rise in future seasons as new sponsorship deals are agreed. The most recent deal was a five-year agreement with Virgin Media worth £4 million per season.

As you can see, Southampton FC make a lot of money through a number of different sources. This allows them to compete in the transfer market and sign some of the Premier League’s top players.

#  The gamble that is Southampton FC!

Southampton FC have always been a club that have been on the brink of greatness.

They have a rich history in English football, and have always had players that could make a difference.

However, they always seem to find themselves in a difficult position financially.

This has led to them making some risky decisions in the transfer market over the years.

One of these gambles was the decision to sign striker Dani Osvaldo from Roma in 2013.

The move cost Southampton £15 million, and Osvaldo was quickly made their team captain.

However, things soon went wrong for both Osvaldo and Southampton.

Osvaldo failed to settle in England, and had several run-ins with both teammates and opponents.

This led to him being banned from the first team, and he eventually left the club in 2014.

This was a costly mistake by Southampton, as they ended up losing £15 million on a player who contributed nothing to the club.

#  Southampton FC – the team that loves to gamble!

 Southampton FC has always been a club that loves to gamble.

Back in the early days of their existence, they would often spend big money on signing players in the hope that they could achieve Premier League success.

While this gamble hasn’t always paid off, it has resulted in some memorable moments for the club’s fans.

Let’s take a look at some of Southampton FC’s biggest gambles over the years…

1. The signing of Dani Osvaldo in 2013 was a huge gamble for the club.

At the time, Osvaldo was one of the most sought-after strikers in Europe, so it was a real surprise when he signed for Southampton FC.

The Italian striker didn’t disappoint, scoring some crucial goals for the club during his two-year spell at St Mary’s Stadium.

2. Southampton FC’s decision to appoint Mauricio Pochettino as manager in 2013 was also a big gamble.

Pochettino had no prior experience of managing in the Premier League, so there were plenty of doubts about whether he could be successful at Southampton FC.

However, Pochettino impressed right from the start and led the club to an impressive eighth-place finish in his first season in charge.

3. The signings of Sadio Mane and Graziano Pelle ahead of the 2014/15 season were both major gambles by Southampton FC.

Mane had never played in the Premier League before, while Pelle had only spent one season in England with Newcastle United.

However, both players thrived under Pochettino and quickly established themselves as key members of the team.
