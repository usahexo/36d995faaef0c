#  Betfair and Betdaq announce closure of casino businesses

Betfair and Betdaq are two of the largest online betting exchanges in the world. The two companies have today announced that they will be shutting down their casino businesses.

The decision is said to have been made in order to focus on their core operations - sports betting. The casino businesses of Betfair and Betdaq have been struggling in recent years, with both companies reporting losses.

This is not the first time that the two companies have shut down parts of their businesses; in 2016, they closed down their poker businesses. At the time, this was also attributed to a desire to focus on their core operations.

The move will see around 100 jobs lost, with employees being offered redundancy packages. Both companies are based in the United Kingdom.

Betfair and Betdaq are not the only online betting exchanges to face problems in recent years. In 2017, German exchange Bet365 closed its exchange business after it was unable to compete with the larger exchanges.

#  Poker hands order to cease operations on Betfair and Betdaq

The poker industry is in disarray this week as rumours circulate that two of the biggest online poker companies, Betfair and Betdaq, are set to cease operations.

According to sources close to the companies, the move comes as a result of the decision by PokerStars, the world’s largest online poker company, to stop processing payments from UK customers.

This leaves Betfair and Betdaq with no other option but to shut down their operations in order to protect their own businesses.

Both companies have issued statements confirming that they are ceasing operations, with Betfair adding that it will be seeking a buyer for its business.

PokerStars’ decision is said to be in retaliation for new anti-money laundering regulations introduced by the UK government at the beginning of this year.

The regulations require online poker companies to carry out more stringent identity checks on their customers, something that PokerStars says is not possible given its size.

#  Customers express dismay as casino closures announced

Many Atlantic City casino customers say they are dismayed by the announcement that four casinos will close.

The casinos shutting down are Trump Plaza, Showboat, Revel and Atlantic Club.

"I'm really sad. I come here a lot," said Carol, a Trump Plaza customer. "It's kind of like my home away from home."

The closures mean the loss of nearly 8,000 jobs.

Atlantic City Mayor Don Guardian says he is committed to helping the workers find new jobs.

"We're going to do everything we can to make sure that those individuals have the best opportunity to get new employment," Guardian said.

Some workers say they are not sure what they will do next.

"I don't know if anybody has anything for me," said Crystal, a Trump Plaza worker. "I've been here 10 years."

#  Poker hands order players will have to find another home

The board announced that the poker hands order will have to find another home. The players were not happy with the decision.

"I can't believe this is happening," said one player. "We've been here for years and now we're being kicked out."

The decision came as a surprise to many of the players. It was unclear why the hands had to leave, but the players were determined to find out.

They began meeting with city officials to see if there was any way they could stay. But it soon became clear that there was no way to keep them in their current location.

The players decided to launch a social media campaign to try and get the city's attention. They created a website and started posting on Twitter and Facebook.

They also reached out to local reporters in an attempt to get more coverage of their story. Slowly but surely, the word began to spread.

People started talking about the poker hands order and how they were being forced out of their home. Some even offered to help the players fight for their rights.

Eventually, the city officials took notice and agreed to meet with the players. They listened to their concerns and explained why they were making this decision.

In the end, the officials decided that the poker hands order could stay in their current location, but they would have to follow some new rules. The players were happy with this resolution and vowed to work together with the city officials moving forward.

#  Casino closures a major blow to online poker industry

The recent spate of casino closures has sent shockwaves throughout the online poker industry, with several operators already announcing plans to shutter their operations.

The biggest blow was dealt to PokerStars, which announced on Tuesday that it would be closing its doors in the US market. The Rational Group, which owns PokerStars, said that the decision was made in light of the recent crackdown on online gambling by the Department of Justice.

Other operators that have announced plans to close their doors include Ultimate Poker and Cereus Poker Network (Absolute Poker and Ultimate Bet).

While the news is a major setback for the industry, there is still some hope for online poker players. Several operators, including Bodog and 888Poker, have said that they will continue to offer their services in the US market.

Bodog has also announced plans to expand its operations into new markets, including Canada and Latin America.
