#  What is Cherry Bomb Deluxe?

Cherry Bomb Deluxe is a game for mobile devices that was released in March of 2018. It is a free to play game with in-app purchases available. The game is set in the city of San Francisco and players take on the role of a demolition worker trying to destroy buildings before time runs out.
