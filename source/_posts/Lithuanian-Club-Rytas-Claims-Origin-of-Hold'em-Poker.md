#  Lithuanian Club Rytas Claims Origin of Hold'em Poker

A group of Lithuanian researchers from the Club Rytas have announced that they have discovered the true origins of Texas Hold’em poker. The club, which is a private organization devoted to the study and promotion of Lithuanian culture and history, announced their findings at a press conference in Vilnius on Wednesday.

The researchers said that they had traced the game back to a seventeenth century Lithuanian card game called “vilkpėdžio šaudymas”, which translates as “wolf shooting”. According to the club, the game was initially played with a deck of 36 cards, consisting of numbers 2 through 10, as well as three special characters – a dog, a deer, and a wolf.

The object of the game was to take as many cards as possible from the other players by either capturing them in sequences or by taking them with specific cards called “vikings”. The player who captured the most cards won the game.

The Club Rytas researchers said that they had found evidence that Hold’em poker was first played in early nineteenth century Lithuania. At that time, it was known as “laba diena”, which means “good day”. The game was played with a deck of 52 cards and followed many of the same rules as modern Hold’em poker.

According to the club, Hold’em poker began to spread throughout Europe in the early twentieth century. It eventually reached North America, where it became one of the most popular casino games.

#  Lithuanian Club Rytas Claims to Be the Inventor of Hold'em Poker

On October 10, 2017, Lithuanian Club Rytas claimed that they had invented poker in 1875 and released a statement. To support their claim, the club pointed to a document from 1875 that listed "Rytas Hold'em" as one of the club's games.

The document in question is a list of club activities from 1875. It includes a section on "games played", which mentions "Rytas Hold'em" as one of the games played by the club. There is no mention of poker being invented in 1875 anywhere else in the document.

However, some poker experts have disputed Rytas Club's claim. They argue that poker was most likely invented much earlier than 1875 and that the document from Rytas Club is not conclusive evidence that they were the inventors of poker.

Despite the controversy, Rytas Club's claim has generated a lot of interest in Lithuania and around the world. It has also sparked a debate about who invented poker and when it was first played.

#  Lithuanian Club Rytas Claims Credit for Popularity of Hold'em Poker

Lithuanian Club Rytas is taking credit for the recent popularity of Hold'em poker. The club has been holding regular tournaments for over a decade, and its members have included some of the country's top professional players.

The game has become so popular that the Lithuanian government recently legalized it, and there are now dozens of casinos that offer Hold'em games. Many of the top poker players in the world got their start in Lithuania, and the country is now considered a major center for professional poker.

Club Rytas is hoping to capitalize on this success by hosting a major tournament next year that will likely attract some of the best players in the world. The club is also working to develop new variants of Hold'em that will appeal to Lithuanians and other European players.

#  Lithuanian Club Rytas Says It Created and Popularized Hold'em Poker

Officially registered in 2006, Lithuanian Club Rytas (LCR) declared that it is the first entity to have created and popularized hold'em poker. In a statement released by LCR on its website, the club asserted that it has been holding tournaments and coaching sessions since 2004, which would make it the first to offer the game to the public.

"The fact that many people know about poker only because of large American tournaments or Hollywood films is a clear indicator that this game has been successfully exported from Lithuania," said LCR in a statement.

LCR also claims to have "developed dozens of professional players who now make their living exclusively from playing poker."

While there is no clear evidence to support LCR's assertion, the club has certainly helped put Lithuania on the map as a hotbed for Hold'em poker. In addition to running regular tournaments, LCR also offers coaching sessions for aspiring players.

#  Lithuanian Club Rytas Claims to Have Invented the Modern Version of Hold'em Poker

On a quiet evening in Vilnius, the Lithuanian capital, a group of poker enthusiasts were discussing the latest developments in the game of poker. The conversation turned to a discussion of a new variation of poker that had been developed by one of their own, an anonymous member of the group who called himself Rytas.

According to Rytas, he had developed a new version of poker that was faster and more exciting than traditional poker. This new game, which he called "Texas Hold'em", was based on traditional draw poker, but with some important differences. In particular, each player was dealt two cards face down, rather than the five cards used in traditional draw poker.

The players then placed their bets and two additional cards were dealt face up, one at a time. The player with the best hand won the pot. Rytas claimed that this new version of poker was more exciting and faster than traditional draw poker and that it would soon become the most popular form of the game.

His friends were skeptical but decided to give Texas Hold'em a try. They were quickly hooked on this new game and soon it was being played in clubs all over Vilnius. Within a few years, Texas Hold'em had spread throughout Europe and eventually to the rest of the world.
